      The right column shows you the sentence that you are reading. The word colored blue is the word that you are expected to read.<br>
      Once you finish the sentence, the sentence will appear on the left column, and a new sentence will appear on the right. The words that were correctly pronounced will be colored green and the words that were not, red.<br>
      You can check the status of your microphone by looking at the tab or the right hand corner of the page. If the microphone is on, there will be a red dot on the tab where this page is loaded, and on the right hand corner, it will say "Mic ON" in green. If not, it will say "Mic OFF", and the red dot will not be on the tab.
